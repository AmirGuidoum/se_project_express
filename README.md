# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

The back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. You’ll gain a deeper understanding of how to work with databases, set up security and testing, and deploy web applications on a remote machine. The eventual goal is to create a server with an API and user authorization.

## Running the Project

`npm run start` — to launch the server

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

### Testing

Before committing your code, make sure you edit the file `sprint.txt` in the root folder. The file `sprint.txt` should contain the number of the sprint you're currently working on. For ex. 12

# WTWR (What to Wear?) - Back End

## Technologies and Techniques Used

### Technologies

- **Node.js** and **Express.js** for building the REST API
- **MongoDB** for the database (or another database system)
- **Mongoose** for data modeling
- **Nodemon** for auto-reloading during development

### Techniques

- RESTful API design for clear and maintainable endpoints
- Centralized error handling to provide consistent API responses
- Writing unit and integration tests to ensure server reliability
- Preparing the application for deployment on cloud or remote servers
